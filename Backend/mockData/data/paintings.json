    "description": " a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

Alka Seltzer is one of Lichtenstein’s watershed works because it shows the artist summing up his early graphic techniques and introducing what would become his most significant formal preoccupations in the years that followed",

The fierce figure is denoted by two eyes, an elfin ear, nose, lips, bared teeth, and a patch of red dots that stand in for a rouged cheek.",

As he admitted a few years later, “I’d prefer to remain a mystery, I never like to give my background and, anyway, I make it all up different every time I’m asked.” This work marked a starting point for Warhol’s career-long engagement with the construction of identity, especially as it pertained to crafting his public persona.",
