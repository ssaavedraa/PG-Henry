    "description": " a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

    "description": "Katsushika Hokusai’s much celebrated series, Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), was begun in 1830, when the artist was 70 years old. This tour-de-force series established the popularity of landscape prints, which continues to this day. Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. ",

I've looked back at my old art and realized that years ago I tended to draw people in huddled positions with their backs to the world, I think unconsciously it was an expression of my vulnerability, insecurity, fear... While that I now feel so at ease and capable, a sense of being one with my own being that I have never experienced before. A kind of healing that feels like landing back in my own body after not being fully there for for as long as I can remember... The way I no longer feel suffocated and terrified is really unreal.",
