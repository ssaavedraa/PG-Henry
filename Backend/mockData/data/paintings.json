Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

    "description": "It's so hard to put into words: truly connecting and accepting myself, finding the ability to comb through and deal with the past, understanding how to live with certain truths instead of desperately hoping they'll go away, the relief and sense of growth that comes out of all of this. I've looked back at my old art and realized that years ago I tended to draw people in huddled positions with their backs to the world, I think unconsciously it was an expression of my vulnerability, insecurity, fear... While that I now feel so at ease and capable, a sense of being one with my own being that I have never experienced before. A kind of healing that feels like landing back in my own body after not being fully there for for as long as I can remember... The way I no longer feel suffocated and terrified is really unreal.",

This device, known as a water glass or sponge glass, was used to stabilize the surface of moving water with the to improve visibility. It is possible that Homer was attracted to the subject because the surface of the water in constant movement, as well as its transparency, attracts attention, aspects of the sea that intrigued him especially in the Bahamas.",
