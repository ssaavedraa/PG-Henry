His studies were interrupted by a three-year stint in the Army during and after World War II between 1943 and 1946. After being in training programs for languages, engineering, and pilot training, all of which were cancelled, he served as an orderly, draftsman, and artist.",

Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

En 1998 comenzó a utilizar espátula y se dedico sobre todo a paisajes de la Provenza, con sus colores vibrantes e intensos. En sus pinturas ha retratado con fidelidad la luz y el calor del verano de la región. Amapolas de color rojo brillante, girasoles anaranjados, campos, casas modestas en el lateral de la carretera que se escapan en la distancia ... en los paisajes del autor se pueden ver algunas similitudes con las obras de su maestro e inspirador, V. Van Gogh. Expuso sus obras en la Florida, Francia, Dinamarca, Alemania, España y Marruecos y sus pinturas se encuentran en muchas colecciones privadas en Francia, Bélgica, EE.UU., Dinamarca, Alemania, España, República Checa y Marruecos.
