His studies were interrupted by a three-year stint in the Army during and after World War II between 1943 and 1946. After being in training programs for languages, engineering, and pilot training, all of which were cancelled, he served as an orderly, draftsman, and artist.",

Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

In 1998 he began to use a spatula and devoted himself above all to landscapes of Provence, with their vibrant and intense colours. In his paintings he has faithfully portrayed the light and heat of the region's summer. Bright red poppies, orange sunflowers, fields, modest houses on the side of the road receding into the distance... in the author's landscapes one can see some similarities with the works of his teacher and inspirer, V. Van Gogh. He exhibited his works in Florida, France, Denmark, Germany, Spain and Morocco and his paintings are in many private collections in France, Belgium, USA, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic and Morocco.",

Furthermore, through years of experience with body control, as well as the insight of an expert in body language, which I acquired in the long years as a trainer, choreographer and dancer, I bring my paintings to life in a very artistic way. When I finish a painting, I am ready for it to find its new home. I've had my time creating and developing, and when it's over, my time with it is over and I know it was created for someone else's enjoyment. I love what I do. I love creating works of art and I am proud of the images I create. Beautiful and meaningful images that speak to people as much as they spoke to me.",

I've looked back at my old art and realized that years ago I tended to draw people in huddled positions with their backs to the world, I think unconsciously it was an expression of my vulnerability, insecurity, fear... While that I now feel so at ease and capable, a sense of being one with my own being that I have never experienced before. A kind of healing that feels like landing back in my own body after not being fully there for for as long as I can remember... The way I no longer feel suffocated and terrified is really unreal.",
